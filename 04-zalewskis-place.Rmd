# Zalewski's place

As it turned out, the only one of us that Caleb Shivers tied up was Fulton Gully. Randall Wragge moved the horse van behind the barn so that it wouldn't be seen from the driveway. The van moved in stops and starts and I saw, then, why Randall Wragge preferred horses. He came back glowering and the five of us went inside the barn.

Caleb Shivers pushed Fulton Gully onto a hay bale against the far wall. Then he turned to look, first, at me and Willie and, then, at his and Randall Wragge's horses. The animals were tied into Chips' stall, eating from their feed bags. Then he looked between us and the horses again, but with more *meaning*, and finished up with his head tilted to one side, eyes wide open in my direction.

Randall Wragge sighed. "Caleb, maybe the reason you get hungry so often is you ain't worked out what your mouth *does* yet. What stops you being polite and just asking the boy?"

Caleb Shivers stopped looking at me and turned to Randall Wragge. "I know what using my mouth and being polite gets me, Randall. How many times I need to say it? How can you get told?"

Randall Wragge sighed again and shook his head. From their manner, I guessed that this quarrelling was normal, rather than them getting ready to shoot each other. "Lucky Joe", he said, "a barn includes food, at least by my definition. So that agreement we made covers you fixing us a meal, don't it?"

That sparked something in me, but I held back my anger. "We ain't going to let a guest starve", I said, stony-voiced.

Randall Wragge sighed again. "I insulted Oklahoma before you came on out", he said to Caleb Shivers, as if that explained matters. "Don't be sore on that, Lucky Joe. What did this State ever do for you, anyhow? Seems like your soil ain't fit for a graveyard and most of what you earn, that fellow"—and he pointed at Fulton Gully—"ends up wearing".

"Or eating", Caleb Shivers said.

"*Okay*, Caleb", Randall Wragge said, spitting the words.

"We'll both go", I said and I gestured for Willie, who had been looking bemused this whole time, to follow me.

"Hurry back", Randall Wragge said.

"And just because I have to sleep like an animal, doesn't mean I want to eat like one", Caleb Shivers said.

As I shut the barn door, I could see that they'd already come together and started whispering out of Fulton Gully's earshot.

When we were out of the barn, Willie was jumping from foot to foot and desperate to talk, but I shushed him until we were a good distance down the driveway.

"Why'd that man say he was going to sleep here?", Willie said, when I let him speak.

"Just for one night", I said. "To help us. We owe Mr Gully a heap of money, Willie, and we don't have it. They'll help us get it."

"Sleep in a barn", Willie said, with scorn. And then he added, as if the fearful thought had just grabbed him, "Will they hurt Midnight Runner?"

"No", I said, and then I stopped him on the track by taking hold of his elbow. "Look, why are you even *here*? I told you to go to school".

"You told me Dad was at home", Willie said, and he wrenched his elbow away from me in anger. "But *Pete* said he saw him at Zalewski's place. He'll be sleeping there by now, Joe."

Well, I didn't like that news. I'd thought that Dad had gone into town with the butchered horse meat, and that it would take him a couple of days to spend the proceeds. But if he'd found a way to lose the meat, or lose the money, closer to home, then he'd be home by the evening, and I'd need to get rid of Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers much quicker than I'd planned. I didn't have the first idea how to do that.

"You know what else Pete saw, out at Zalewski's?", Willie said.

"What?", I said.

"A dog", Willie said, "Only, it was sat out on the porch, playing cards. And it was winning, Joe."

"Zalewski doesn't have a porch", I said, "People would fall off it".

The kitchen was empty when we got back to the house. The place seemed hollow; dust hung in the bright sunlight and nothing made a sound. Willie found some biscuits and gravy and got to heating them up.

I left Willie there, humming to himself by the stove, and I went next door, into the unlit den. I wouldn't normally have gone in there, just skirted around the doorway, because it was Dad's room. The room smelt of evaporating alcohol and of the chair in the corner, where Dad sat having his sweats and chills. I wrinkled my nose against the smell, but I knew what I was after in the there: the chest that stood against the right-hand wall. But, as I approached the chest, it was like Dad was sat down in the chair behind me. I felt his eyes creeping down my spine—brooding or furious, we never could tell—and I didn't stop thinking he was *there* until my hands were on the catch and lifting the lid, and I knew what something real felt like.  

Dad kept a pistol in the chest; I'd seen him sit there in the dark, turning the gun between his fingers. I didn't know if the pistol would fire, since I'd never seen him use it, or clean it. But it was better than nothing and, unlike the shotgun, I could get it up to the barn without Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers seeing. Sure enough, I found the pistol underneath a lot of other junk: a garrison cap like the one Caleb Shivers wore, a broken kerosene lamp, the head of a hand axe, a folder of curling photographs. When I pulled the box out, my hands were somehow black with oil. Just as I was about to pull the pistol from the box and inspect it, there was a sharp rapping from the wall next to me and, startled, I lost my grip on the box and the bullets inside scattered onto the hard floor.

"Joe?", I heard Willie call out, and his voice was quiet and urgent, so I knew that he'd had the same thought as me: that Dad was back already. 

A few seconds of silence, and the rapping started again—weaker this time, but still urgent-sounding. For a second I thought it was Dad, back already
