The people, places and times have been switched around some, but they are real. I did not change much: a few names, the textures of the earth, the tint of the sky, the precise words chosen and the precise moment those words were spoken. Details, only. But, still, as a historian I have the power to go back and alter past events. That power comes not from lying, exactly, but from finessing. Fill in enough unknown details of the past, or smooth off enough rough edges, and a new interpretation of events starts to emerge: mine. This book would not exist if its protagonist had that same power. An animal unstartled, the same words uttered in another tone, a look not returned, the hands of the clock at different angle, a barrel aimed a few degrees to the left — any of these might have led to a very different story, one not likely to have been recorded, or been so regretted. This book is not a work of fiction, then, but it is still based on a lie: that we can reach into the past, and change what we find there. Jack Lord, PhD, 2016 "],
["from-a-quiet-field.html", "Chapter 1 From a quiet field", " Chapter 1 From a quiet field Not a week after seeing that horse van for the first time, I had to shoot my kid brother square in the chest. We had a farm in Oklahoma. This was 1939, so by then the drought had done its work, and the land had beaten my parents half to death. Dad was in drink all night, and corked out in the toolshed for most of the day. Mama had one arm bent useless, and I knew it was Dad that had done it. So it was me and the kid, Willie, who had to put the sweat of our brows into the farm. We hadn’t the first idea what we were doing but it was more fun than our school lessons, and we preferred eating to starving, so we stuck at it. Before I tell you about the horse van, let me tell you about our horse, Chips. This horse wasn’t ours, but we rented him from the local swell, Fulton Gully, so that we could plough the fields. Willie would have nothing to do with Chips, because he was a stubborn horse who would get riled at the prospect of work. Willie preferred to mooch around the field, weeding with a hoe - and that got me riled up, I can tell you. But it didn’t matter how much I threatened Willie, he was more scared of being kicked by Chips than of a whipping from his brother, and I couldn’t get him near that horse. But, as much as Willie hated Chips, he loved the other horse that Fulton Gully owned. Maybe even more than Fulton Gully did - and Fulton Gully loved that horse a lot. Fulton Gully’s other horse was called Midnight Runner, because he was a damn racehorse. I can see why Willie loved that horse. When you saw him sauntering along a broke-up road, in a place where the crops were as brittle as chalk, where half the houses were boarded up, and the kids looked as old as grandparents - when you saw that horse, in that place, it was a kind of miracle. He had nobility, did Midnight Runner - and when I saw the kid looking at the horse, I knew that he was seeing something else entirely, something beyond the dirt track, and the hoe, and the drunk snoring in the toolshed who broke our Mama. I suppose I loved that horse too. But I had another reason for liking Midnight Runner. Our farm was close to the road, but hidden from it by a small rise, so we could hear everything that approached while we worked the fields. And we knew when Midnight Runner was approaching because his hooves hit the ground clear and hard: tlot tlot, tlot tlot! All the other horses in the neighbourhood seemed to slough their hooves down softly, the way me and Willie dawdled our feet on the way to school. And where Midnight Runner was, Fulton Gully would be, fat and proud and wanting to show off, his purple jacket full of apples and sugar cubes. When we heard that signature tlot tlot, we’d hare up and over the rise and flag down Fulton Gully, and he’d make a big show of handing over an apple and a sugar cube to each of us to give to Midnight Runner. But if we were quick with our fingers, Midnight Runner might only get of one our apples and one of our sugar cubes, and we could sit in the field afterward and eat what we stole. The week before the horse van appeared, we weren’t quick enough, and so we came away with nothing - just the sight of Midnight Runner, and a soft clap on his flank that made Fulton Gully frown. Scrambling down the rise on our way back, Willie said to me, “I wish we could just take him.” I wasn’t sure if he meant Midnight Runner or Fulton Gully, though I suppose it didn’t make much difference. Anyway: the horse van. We were out in the fields, Willie poking around in the wheat with his hoe, me glowering at him while I led Chips around the next plot with the plough. It was a late afternoon, a cold air, nothing to be heard out there except a few crows and the clink of our tools. And then we heard a great rattling and rumbling approach from the North. Me and the kid looked at each other. Willie had dropped his hoe already. We knew it was an engine, of course, but since our road only ever saw horses - and mostly old nags at that - we knew we had to go take a look. I dropped Chips’ rein, left the horse with the plough, and we hot-footed it over the rise. I saw the vehicle bumping along the road from a distance. It was a sight, more like a house on wheels than anything. All bright chrome up the front, with the driver’s cab and the cargo space done out in red and black wood, white-trimmed windows like you’d see in a mansion, and a sloping roof with a flag - a flag! - on the top. I laughed at the sight of it. But, as it pulled to a stop alongside us, I stopped laughing. One of the panels on the van was painted with the picture of a horse, and Fulton Gully was leaning a purple-coated elbow out of the near-side window. “Boys”, he said. His face was wobbling with pride. “Mr Gully”, I said. Willie took his hat off, but I left mine on, and I could see Fulton Gully’s mouth twitch. “Where’s Midnight Runner today, Mr Gully?”, Willie said. I scowled at the kid, but he was oblivious. My chest was tense. “I’ll show you!”, Fulton Gully said, and he jumped out of the cab. “Come.” We followed him round to the far side of the van and, on the way, I think Willie must have seen the picture of the horse for the first time because his face changed, for the worse. Fulton Gully opened a full-sized door in the side of the van and the smell of hay and horse came from the darkness. For a second or two, I could see nothing but the bulk of Fulton Gully, the rolls of his purple back and the shadows in front of him. And when Fulton Gully shifted aside, and my eyes adjusted a little, I could see Midnight Runner in there, his head drooping over a little wooden fence, and all the muscle and fight seemed gone from that horse. “Hop up”, Fulton Gully said, “you can feed him”. We went up, and I was numb while we were in the van. I took the apple and I took the sugar cube, and the whole time Fulton Gully was in there with us, watching our hands. And as we fed the horse, there wasn’t anything to look at but the blackness behind him, nothing to hear but the engine still turning in front, and nothing to smell but the hay and Midnight Runner’s shit. We got out, and we stood there and watched Fulton Gully lumber himself back into the van, and then it was like Willie woke up - he hadn’t spoken the whole time in the van - because he asked, all of a sudden, “Where are you taking Midnight Runner?” “For a proper run”, Fulton Gully said, “Somewhere nice.” And then he left. We watched the van leave and, when it was gone, Willie said “I don’t mind watching the horse leave, if he’s running”. We stood for a moment, in the quiet again now, hands in our empty pockets, with the crows whirling in the gray sky. And then from beyond the rise, I heard Chips make a sound, the kind of sound that you don’t want to hear a horse make, and I realised that something was terribly wrong in the field. We both ran. All the way back, I thought: how long had Chips been keening for, while Fulton Gully’s van made its racket? At the top of the rise, I saw what must have happened. The noise of the van had frightened Chips and he had stepped back into the plough and got himself tangled somehow. Now he was wrenching himself back and forth in panic, and making his terrible noise. “Quick”, I said to Willie, because we’d both stopped for a second, “he’ll break his leg”. And I didn’t need to add: and we’ll owe Fulton Gully a horse. But as we were running towards Chips, I saw another silhouette coming from the direction of the farm. The noise had woken Dad, and he was walking towards Chips with a strange, halting gait. And even though he was slow, and he waltzed unevenly, he was going to reach the horse before us. I could tell he was still half-cooked, but that horse was worth more than we could afford to lose, and so I risked shouting to him, “Be careful!” He gave no sign that he had heard me, and loped onwards. There was something unnatural about Dad in that moment. The shape of him, black against the setting sun, looked wrong. And the determined way that he approached the horse seemed familiar. One hand on the kitchen table to support himself, as he came closer. My stomach lurched. But then Chips stopped his keening. Dad had the horse’s face in his hand, had soothed him somehow. Willie stopped running, and looked back at me in relief. And then Dad raised his right arm up, the setting sun flashed off his shotgun, he dropped the calming hand from Chips’ face, and gave the horse both barrels. That night, I knew two things. The farm was ruined, finally. And that my only way out was to do to Fulton Gully what my father had done to that horse. "],
["a-soldier-rides.html", "Chapter 2 A soldier rides", " Chapter 2 A soldier rides Dad butchered the horse that night but, of course, he made a mess of it because he was in drink. I hadn’t the heart to make Willie clean up what was left, so I sent him to tidy the barn instead. I stood in that field for a good long time before I made myself get to the work. The crows watched me, and a pair of gray jays sat on the edge of the field, heads to one side, eyeing up the carrion. I did the necessary, but my stomach was acid by the end of it. The jays knew I was beat then and they hopped up next to me to pick on the leftovers. When I finished, I could hear a horse on the road coming from the South. Not the lazy hooves of a nag: the real tlot tlot of Midnight Runner, coming at a canter. At first I thought it was my imagination, Chips living again after I’d picked him from the earth. But, no, the hooves were real. The horse van was just a one-off, I thought. Willie would want to see, but I wasn’t sure of my voice, so I left him in the barn rather than holler. I got to the top of the rise as the rider came round the curve from the South. It wasn’t Fulton Gully, and he wasn’t on Midnight Runner. It was a proper horse, though, with a brute of a man on top. He pulled up alongside me. He was in his forties, a craggy face, weathered and reddened in the sun, with a great slab of black beard. He tipped his hat backwards until it fell and, afterwards, it lay hanging from a cord against his fur tunic. He spat, and stared at my bloody clothes and hands. “By the looks of you, the rabbit you fought must of come close to winning”. Well, I didn’t like that, because I was strong for my age, and he surely knew it. “It was a horse”, I said, and I gave the jugular of his beast a long look, turning my body to show him the knife at my belt. That made him very grave. “Do you think, boy, that because I was careless enough to lose a hand, I couldn’t shoot you through the eyeball with the one I got left?” The truth is, I didn’t realise that he only had one hand until he raised up his stump and showed me the reins knotted round them. And then, with one movement, he whipped the stump down, unknotting the rein, and whipped his other arm up, and he had a gun in his hand. I knew when I was beaten, and I shifted my body round so the knife was out of sight. “It was a horse”, I repeated, “But your horse is a sight bigger”. He nodded at that and, as quick as it came out, the gun was gone. Save for his face, the man was almost all black. The animal-fur cloak, the boots, the beard, his horse: all black. But when he moved, I saw flashes of metal come and then go. The plating of his Colt shone in its holster. He had medals pinned to his chest and, when his cloak shifted, I could see their burnish and the faded service ribbons. He had a gold tooth that flinted when he spoke. Those flashes seemed to come from a void. He set me on edge, that man. But I kept right on talking to him. “What’s your name, boy?”, he asked me. “Joe”, I said. “Nice to meet you, Lucky Joe”, he said to me, with his eyes hard on mine. “Just Joe”, I said to him. “I drew my gun on you, and you ain’t dead. You’re not two feet away from me, covered in blood, and you ain’t dead. You seem the kind of boy who should be pleased at what happenstance has brung his way, Lucky Joe.” I shrugged at him, and he seemed to take this as assent. “They call me Randall Wragge”, he said. There was an arrogant gravel in his voice, and I took that to mean he didn’t care if I believed him or not. “Now, Lucky Joe, tell me: you know a man named Fulton Gully? Tomorrow I expect to meet him on this very road, riding a very fine horse.” The way that this Randall Wragge was talking - so open - confirmed what I already half-knew: the man was mostly devil. But I couldn’t keep from conversing with him. Now I like to tell myself that I kept on with Randall Wragge because the last bit of angel left me the day before, when I watched my father shoot that horse clean through the head. But maybe that isn’t the truth of it, maybe I’d been waiting for the devil to ride up this whole time. “Yessir”, I said, “I know Fulton Gully”. And I was thinking, by then, that me owing Fulton Gully a horse might not be such a problem if this Randall Wragge caught up to him first. Randall Wragge nodded, and then he looked at the blood on my clothes again, and pointed his chin at the rise behind me. “And, it seems to me, that you must have come from somewhere, Lucky Joe. Am I right? Someplace where you’re going to wash those clothes. Someplace close by. Someplace that I can’t see from the road?” I nodded and then, before Randall Wragge could start up again, I said, “You’re not going to meet Fulton Gully on no horse. They’ll both come by here, you’re right about that. But Fulton Gully won’t be riding no horse.” Randall Wragge’s eyes lit up with a kind of fury at that. But I carried on. “And he won’t stop on the road for you neither, Mr Wragge, he’s suspicious like”. I stopped for a second because my mouth was dry, and because I thought it polite to give Randall Wragge a chance to shoot me. And, when he didn’t, I carried on. “But Fulton Gully will stop for me. He’ll stop for me, if I ask him to.” And after I said that, something changed in Randall Wragge’s attitude toward me. I wasn’t just a kid he was toying with on the side of the road anymore. “Show me this place you got”, he said. I guessed it was the closest he could get to a respectful tone. When we got to the top of the rise, Willie was standing in the empty field, poking with his shoe at the stains that Dad’s butchering had left. The sun was bright in the sky and, when I closed my eyes for a second, all I could see was red. I could hear Randall Wragge grunting in satisfaction. “I could make a thing or two happen here”, he said. And, as I listened to him speak, all I could think about was getting Randall Wragge’s Colt off his hip and into my hands. "],
["a-circle-of-blood.html", "Chapter 3 A circle of blood", " Chapter 3 A circle of blood The next morning, I waited alone on the road for the horse van to come by. I wanted Willie out of the way and so I had sent him to school, telling him that Dad was on the warpath, and that he would be better off out of it. I stood there a while, kicking my feet in the dust, and feeling the bile in my stomach rush about. I didn’t know if the bile came from fear, or from hatred of Fulton Gully. Nothing appeared on that road for a good long time. Despite my stomach, I was getting up an appetite when I finally heard the engine and saw dust rising up beyond the bend. When the van itself appeared, I ran straight for it, flapping my arms like a bird. “Mr Gully!”, I shouted, “Stop! Please!” And I didn’t give him much choice about stopping, because the road was narrow, the van was a lumbering thing and I was headlong for it. I could see Fulton Gully’s fat face, half-shocked and half-annoyed, gasping through the windshield. He pulled up short, and I ran on, planting my hands on the hood so that he couldn’t drive off again. He leant out the window. “What’s this?” “Mr Gully”, I said, panting. “It’s Willy, he’s hurt. Really bad. I need your help”. I could see him hesitate. “Where are your parents?”, he said. The bile was hatred, but I swallowed it. “Mama’s in town, Mr Gully.” I said nothing about Dad because, why would I, given Fulton Gully’s dealings with us? “I need your van, to run him into the doctor.” And, while he was looking shocked at that, I took my hands off the hood, walked round to the cab and got in. “Thank you, Mr Gully”, I said. I was wringing my cap in my hands as I said this, and had a look of gratitude on my face, but, still, his eyes were bulging at my impertinence. “I’ve got a busy day”, Fulton Gully said, angling his head towards Midnight Runner’s compartment. But he must have seen that my eyes were damp because, even as he spoke, I could see that his attitude was changing. He was still affecting to be annoyed, but now he had the look of a man weighing up whether being a hero was worth more than the inconvenience. I think he was half in the cab with me, and half at the bar accepting his due already. “Where would we put him?”, Fulton Gully said. He had already restarted the van and moved off. “In the compartment, with Midnight Runner”, I said, my voice half broken. “There’s space. I’ll stay back there with him.” “Mmm”, Fulton nodded. “He won’t make a mess”, I said. “Only of the hay, and I’ll clean it out.” “Oh, I wasn’t thinking of that, of course”, Fulton Gully said, and wobbled his neck to reassure me and him both. A few seconds passed, of him thinking on other things. “Yes, we’ll pick up your boy. No problem”. Well, I had him now, and no mistake. Fulton Gully had always seemed so large to me: riding past on his magnificent horse, or answering the door while I stood two steps down on the porch with the rent money for Chips in my hand. But, sitting there in the cab, he looked so much smaller, and I had the knife on my belt to level us further if I needed it. The van bumped along the uneven road. I felt bad for Midnight Runner being shaken around back there. “Turn here, Mr Gully”, I said, because I didn’t want him to miss the long path down to our farm. “Alright”, he said and he gave me a reassuring smile. “It will be alright, Joe”. When he spoke, I could smell the sourness of his breath, curdling with the soft drafts of hay coming from the back. Fulton Gully hummed to himself as we went down the track, no doubt thinking on what a great prize it would be to save a farm boy’s life. Since I was after that very same prize, I found it hard to keep up my hating, and I fell instead to worry. I told him to pull up by the barn, which was a fair step from the house. I jumped out, and shouted “Willie! Mr Gully’s here, he’s going to drive you to the doctor!” I was about to run inside the barn, but Fulton Gully was still sat in the van with the engine running. “Mr Gully, I need you to help me carry him outside”, I said, leaning into the cab. “He’s real messed up, and if I drop him, or I can’t support him, I’m afraid he’ll die.” Fulton Gully recoiled at that, but he got out, took off his purple coat, folded it neatly, laid it down on the seat and walked round behind the van to join me. Only he never reappeared, and when I went round to the other side of the van, Fulton Gully was walking away from the barn, towards something that he’d seen. By the time I’d run to catch him up, Fulton Gully was standing over the rust brown patch where Dad had shot and butchered Chips. His mouth was open in horror. “My God”, he said, “is this where it happened? I don’t think I can go in there. That poor boy.” I thought he might faint. It did look pretty bad, I admit, because there is a lot of blood in a horse, and only so much you can do to clean up the soil. “If you went and got Willie”, Fulton Gully said, absently, “I could let you drive into town yourself”. I didn’t know what to do, then, because I needed Fulton Gully inside the barn, and even this offer seemed to make him paler. He was still staring at the ground and patting at his pockets. The next moment, Fulton Gully dropped to one knee and for a moment I thought he had fainted. But he was looking at something in the dirt, something that I’d missed while cleaning the day before, something that told him this wasn’t Willie’s blood at all. And when Fulton Gully stood up, he still looked pale, but now he looked frightened - and angry too. “What happened here?”, he said. “Where’s my horse?” “Nothing. It’s Willie”, I said, and I was stepping backwards because Fulton Gully was advancing on me. Then Fulton Gully had one eye on the knife on my belt, and his face started to purple up. “Why were you waiting for me? How did you know I would come by?” “I didn’t, Mr Gully, I swear”, I said. “You’ve got it wrong”. But, as I said it, I was wondering whether I’d be able to get my knife out before his big body came crashing down on me. “What game are you trying to play with me, boy?” Fulton Gully was shouting now. All of his paleness was gone and I thought he was going to come at me for sure. And then, all of sudden, he stopped, the fight left him and he was looking past my right shoulder. There was a click behind me and, when I turned, Randall Wragge had just stepped out from behind the van. “No game here, Mr Gully’, he said, and his voice was calm and arrogant. He knocked gently on the rear of the horse van with his stump.”Except maybe the sport of kings - and, much as I loved my mama, she didn’t have no title, and I doubt your’s did either.&quot; Randall Wragge beckoned me over with his head. Fulton Gully stood gaping at the two of us. “Mr Gully, I’d like to keep things civil”, Randall Wragge said, “and I figure since I am pointing a gun at you, I get to decide what counts as civil. Don’t cause me no trouble. Don’t call me no names. I ain’t decided whether swearing revenge on this boy is civil or not. It ain’t something that’s ever come up before. But I like choices, Mr Gully, so if you want me to make a choice on that, I will. That clear to you?” “Yes, sir.” Fulton Gully stuttered the words out, and he was back to looking pale. Randall Wragge was still in his all-black get up, hat and all. He hadn’t looked at me this whole time. I couldn’t tell how he was feeling about having had to come out of the barn, and it was making me nervous. “Lucky Joe”, Randall Wragge said, “in about 30 seconds, a black man is going to come out of your barn and I don’t want you to do nothing stupid.” I turned to look at him, because this was the first I’d heard of any other man, and I didn’t understand what he was driving at. “Keep your eyes on Mr Gully, Lucky Joe. Even a fat man can do you damage if he’s desperate.” “I ain’t afraid of a black man, Mr Wragge.” “I’m sure you ain’t. But you live in a state so scared of a black boxer beating a white boxer, it passed a law to stop ’em trying. I’m sure you ain’t afraid, boy, but Oklahoma don’t like a fair fight, and I don’t want you mistakenly drawing that knife.” I scuffed at the dirt with the heel of my boot, and kept on looking at Fulton Gully. When Randall Wragge spoke, it was like he’d torn up open a sack of corn, and it took me a while to collect the meaning of all those words. “Lucky Joe”, Randall Wragge said, and his voice had the same edge to it that he was turning on Fulton Gully. I shrugged because, as I saw things, Randall Wragge had drawn his gun twice since we met, while I hadn’t so much as raised my voice. We didn’t have the chance to disagree on it further because, by then, we could both hear footsteps, and the black man was out from behind the horse van a few seconds after. “Lucky Joe, this is my associate Caleb Shivers. Caleb Shivers: I wouldn’t say that Lucky Joe here owns that barn, as such. But I would say he’s the boy responsible for making it so hospitable”. I had thought Randall Wragge’s warning was about protecting Caleb Shivers but, now that I had seen him, I realised that the warning was to protect me from myself. Like Randall Wragge, Caleb Shivers must have been in his forties. But where Randall Wragge was bulky, Caleb Shivers was slender and wiry. He had an angular face, with dark sunken cheeks. His tight coat was military-looking and he wore a dusty garrison cap, an old one. Everything about his movements was tight and controlled, like he was coiled to strike. I’d have preferred the odds of getting my knife into Fulton Gully than into Caleb Shivers, I knew that much. “Thank you for letting us use your barn, son”, Caleb Shivers said, deadpan. Randall Wragge shifted his weight in dissatisfaction. His voice sounded as if was from out East someplace. “If I sound less excited than Mr Wragge, here, it’s just difficult for me to be truly happy when I’m sleeping in the mud and hay with an animal, even if the host who has put me there is a gracious one.” “You’re welcome, Mr Shivers”, I said, since this seemed the quickest way to move things along. Fulton Gully had been gawping at the scene this whole time and I think he couldn’t quite believe it was real. The truth is that I felt a little that way myself. My arms and legs were floating, almost, and the words felt fuzzy as they left my mouth - but still the seconds kept passing by, and it all kept on happening, tick after tick, tock after tock. “Tie him up and bring him inside”, Randall Wragge said. Caleb Shivers nodded and Fulton Gully emitted a quiet gurgle of horror. “And the kid?” Caleb Shivers said, and my stomach lurched. “No”, Randall Wragge said, “I’d say that Lucky Joe did half a good job, and just got unlucky with this half.” “Not this kid”, Caleb Shivers said, “that kid”. And now the bile in my stomach was back. Willie must have decided to play hooky from school and was now wandering back down the path. When he saw us he waved and, when he saw the horse van, he smiled and broke into a run. From the look on Willie’s face, he thought he was running to feed an apple to Midnight Runner - but by my reckoning he was arrowed straight for the red-rust stain that Chips had left upon the earth.

["zalewskis-place.html", "Chapter 4 Zalewski’s place", " Chapter 4 Zalewski’s place As it turned out, the only one of us that Caleb Shivers tied up was Fulton Gully. Randall Wragge moved the horse van behind the barn so that it couldn’t be seen from the driveway. The van moved in stops and starts and I saw, then, why Randall Wragge preferred horses. He came back glowering and the five of us went inside the barn. Caleb Shivers pushed Fulton Gully onto a hay bale against the far wall. Then he slid his head back and forth, looking first at me and Willie and, then, at his and Randall Wragge’s horses. The animals were tied into Chips’ stall, eating from their feed bags. He looked between us and the horses one last time, but with more meaning, and finished up with his head tilted to one side, eyes wide open in my direction. Randall Wragge sighed. “Caleb, maybe the reason you get so hungry is you ain’t worked out what your mouth does yet. What stops you being polite and just asking the boy?” Caleb Shivers stopped looking at me and turned to Randall Wragge. “I know what using my mouth and being polite gets me, Randall. How many times I need to say it? How can you get told?” Randall Wragge sighed again and shook his head. From their manner, I guessed that this quarrelling was normal, rather than them getting ready to shoot each other. “Lucky Joe”, he said, “a barn ain’t a barn without food. That horse of your’s must have enjoyed his hay in here. Least”—and he looked at Fulton Gully and pointed a finger up to the roof—“until your daddy sent him to that other stable. So that agreement we made covers you fixing us a meal, don’t it?” That sparked something in me, but I held back my anger. “We ain’t going to let a guest starve”, I said, stony-voiced. Randall Wragge sighed again. “I insulted Oklahoma before you came on out”, he said to Caleb Shivers, as if that explained things. “Don’t be sore on that, Lucky Joe. What did this State ever do for you, anyhow? Seems like your soil ain’t fit for a graveyard and most of what you earn, that fellow”—and now he directed his finger at Fulton Gully—“ends up wearing”. “Or eating”, Caleb Shivers said. “Okay, Caleb”, Randall Wragge said and he fair spat the words. “We’ll both go”, I said and I gestured for Willie, who had been looking bemused this whole time, to follow me. “Hurry back now”, Randall Wragge said. “And just because I have to sleep like an animal, it doesn’t mean I want to eat like one”, Caleb Shivers said. As I shut the barn door, I could see that they’d already come together and started whispering out of Fulton Gully’s earshot. When we were out of the barn, Willie was jumping from foot to foot and desperate to talk, but I shushed him until we were a good distance down the driveway. “Why’d that man say he was going to sleep here?”, Willie said, when I let him speak. “Just for one night”, I said. “To help us. We owe Mr Gully a heap of money, Willie, and we don’t have it. They’ll help us get it.” “Sleep in a barn”, Willie said, with scorn. And then he added, as if the fearful thought had just grabbed him, “Will they shoot Midnight Runner?” “No”, I said, and then I stopped him on the track by taking hold of his elbow. “Look, why are you even here? I told you to go to school”. “You told me Dad was drinking at home”, Willie said, and he wrenched his elbow away from me in anger. “But Pete said he saw him go into Zalewski’s place. He’ll be asleep in there by now, Joe.” Well, I didn’t like that news. I’d thought that Dad was headed into town to sell the horse meat, and that it would take him a good couple of days to spend the proceeds. But if he’d found a way to lose the meat, or lose the money, closer to home, then he’d be back by the evening. If Dad was headed back, then I’d need to get rid of Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers much quicker than I’d planned. And, truthfully, now that Caleb Shivers had turned up, I had no idea how to rid of the both of them, fast or slow. “You know what else Pete saw, out at Zalewski’s?”, Willie said. “What?”, I said. “A dog”, Willie said, “Only, it was sat out on the porch, playing cards. And it was winning, Joe.” “Zalewski doesn’t have a porch”, I said, “People would fall off it”. The kitchen was empty when we got back to the house. The place seemed hollow somehow, with just the two of us breaking into the silence, and the dust floating in the sunlight. Willie found some biscuits and gravy and got to heating them up. I left Willie there, humming to himself by the stove, and I went through to the unlit den next door. Normally I’d have just skirted around the doorway because this was Dad’s room. The place smelt of evaporating alcohol and of the chair that Dad sat in while he had his sweats. I wrinkled my nose against the smell, but I knew what I was after: the chest that stood against the right-hand wall. As I approached, it was like Dad had sat down in the chair behind me. I felt his eyes creeping down my spine—brooding or furious, we never could tell—and I couldn’t stop thinking he was there until my hands were on the catch and lifting the lid, and I knew for sure what something real felt like. Dad kept a pistol in the chest; I’d seen him sit there in the dark, turning the gun between his fingers. I didn’t know if the pistol would fire, since I’d never seen him use it, or clean it. But it was better than nothing and, unlike the shotgun, I could get it up to the barn without Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers seeing. Sure enough, I found the pistol underneath a lot of other junk: a garrison cap like the one Caleb Shivers wore, a broken kerosene lamp, the head of a hand axe, a folder of curling photographs. When I pulled the box out, my hands were somehow black with oil. Just as I was about to pull the pistol out and inspect it, there was a sharp rapping from the wall next to me and, startled, I lost my grip on the box and the bullets inside scattered onto the hard floor. “Joe?”, I heard Willie call out, and his voice was quiet and urgent, so I knew that he’d had the same thought as me: that Dad was back already. The smell of Dad’s body seemed to rise up from the chair and choke me, and when I twisted around, my foot sent the bullets scattering off along the hard floor. The noise was like a rattle of footsteps and the den was so dark that, when I turned back towards the door, I was half-blinded by the light coming from the kitchen. “Joe”, Willie said again, “what’s happening?” He sounded scared, but I didn’t want to answer in case Dad found me trying to steal his gun. I tried to creep as silently as I could towards the doorway. There was a few seconds of silence, and the rapping started again—weaker this time, but still urgent-sounding. And, then I realised what the noise was, and I relaxed and walked straight to the kitchen doorway. “What is it, Joe?”, Willie said, turning round to me. He looked like he might cry. “Mama’s awake”, I said, “That’s all”. “Oh”, Willie said, lightening up, “Can I go and see her?” “Sure”, I said, “Take her some of those biscuits”. “You coming to say hello, Joe?”, Willie said. I looked at the box in my hand, and thought about the rapping on the wall. “No”, I said, “I ain’t got time for that”. I had the pistol tucked out of sight, inside my belt and under my shirt, as we walked back towards the barn. Willie was singing to himself, like always when he’d seen Mama. He was a couple of paces ahead of me and I could hear the words filter back: “I’ve a Father on the road, He’s almost done travelling, A Father on the road.” I never sang—something stopped the sound coming out of me—but I liked to hear Willie making a racket anyhow. I felt easier on the way back because I’d an idea, now, of how to get rid of Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers. I knew there was a phone up at Fulton Gully’s place, because I’d stood on his doorstep a time or two, waiting for him to finish talking on it. And I knew that his place was empty, because Fulton Gully was stuck here with us. If Willie could get away—say, if I sent him back with the used dishes so that Caleb Shivers didn’t have to suffer a filthy barn—then he could slip up the road and alert the authorities. The more I thought about the plan, the more I liked it, because Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers were sure to have some kind of reward on their heads, and I could use that money to pay Fulton Gully for Chips. If Fulton Gully still thought I was in on the deal, I could say that Randall Wragge had his gun on me, which was true enough. And, if things went bad, I’d have a pistol stashed nearby to get me and Willie clear. When we came in sight of the barn, Caleb Shivers was leaning up against its near corner, smoking a cigarette. He saw us, pushed off from the wall with his foot and threw the butt onto the floor. He nodded, turned and started to walk back towards the barn doors. I gestured at Willie to follow Caleb Shivers, but I veered off to the other side of the driveway. I’d made up my mind to hide the pistol by the water well. I wanted the pistol close but I figured the quickest way to get killed was to have Randall Wragge find a gun on me. The well was a good spot for it, too. There were enough old rocks at the base that I could make a pile and stash the gun without it being obvious, and I’d have good reason to go out there and fetch it back. I reached the well and let off the handle to drop the bucket. The rope unspooled with a soft whistle and I pushed at a few likely rocks with my foot while the bucket fell. But the well was a long drop and the rusting windlass began to grate just as Caleb Shivers was about to open the barn door—and the noise of it made him turn around. “What are you doing, Joe?”, Caleb Shivers said. There wasn’t any threat about his voice, but that calmness somehow made it worse. “Pulling some water”, I said. “We’ll want some. The food’s awful salty”. “It isn’t”, said Willie. “Leave it alone”, Caleb Shivers said, and there wasn’t room in his tone for an argument. “We’ll make a fire and brew some coffee when we’ve eaten”. Willie made a face, like this was the worst thing he’d heard in the last two days. I came away from the well. Caleb Shivers watched me walk back towards him and I could feel the pistol in my waistband the whole time. But I thought that Caleb Shivers couldn’t be watching me too closely because he was also talking. “Coffee and cigarettes—that’s how you control hunger. Politeness”, Caleb Shivers said, before finally pushing open the barn door, “has got nothing to do with it. You boys should try it, starving out here on your little farm”. The three of us walked inside. “Think you could help us grow tobacco, then?”, Willie said, “For the cigarettes?” Caleb Shivers stopped dead and stared at Randall Wragge. “He ain’t my brother”, Randall Wragge said. And then Caleb Shivers pivoted to stare dead at me. “Your boy going to ask me to cut sugarcane next?”, he said. “No, sir”, I said. “We can get sugar from Mr Gully”, Willie said, “To give to Midnight Runner”. We all looked over at Fulton Gully and that was the first time, I think, that Willie realised what was really happening—because Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers had worked Fulton Gully over while we’d been away, and he was sitting there looking bloody and dazed. Willie looked straight to me, confused, but there wasn’t anything I could tell him. “All that talk”, Randall Wragge said to Fulton Gully, “and you never told us you’d been mistreating that horse, Mr Gully. Horse like that only ever has a custodian, but what kind of custodian poisons his charge with sugar? Matter of fact, the new custodian might not want it known that the old custodian had that horse on a bad diet.” Caleb Shivers looked at Randall Wragge, who nodded—and with two quick paces, Caleb Shivers was right next to me. Before I knew what was happening, Caleb Shivers had pulled up my shirt, lifted the pistol from my waistband and, in one smooth movement, he turned and shot Fulton Gully through the chest. I could hardly hear anything except the ringing in my ears, but I knew that Willie had started to cry. Caleb Shivers had a hold of my elbow and Randall Wragge was coming in close. The barn seemed to be vibrating. Fulton Gully’s body appeared, in the stripes between the jostling of Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers. But then things seemed to clear. I could hear again, and Willie was crying, but softly, as if he was hoping to be forgotten. And Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers seemed to back off, and the thing that confused me the most—Caleb Shivers dropped hold of my elbow, and handed me the gun back. I looked down at the pistol in my hand, then up at Fulton Gully. The blood was spreading across his white shirt and it was like he’d put his purple jacket back on to die. In that moment, I realised that, this whole time, I’d been thinking about the money that we owed to Fulton Gully—but giving him the money back was a whole other business, and I hadn’t been thinking about that at all. The pistol felt hot and heavy in my hand. Caleb Shivers looked me in the eye and said, “Well, you in this pretty deep now, ain’t you, boy?” "]
