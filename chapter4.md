## Part 4 - Zalewski's place

As it turned out, the only one of us that Caleb Shivers tied up was Fulton Gully. Randall Wragge moved the horse van behind the barn so that it wouldn't be seen from the driveway. The van moved in stops and starts and I saw, then, why Randall Wragge preferred horses. He came back glowering and the five of us went inside the barn.

Caleb Shivers pushed Fulton Gully onto a hay bale against the far wall. Then he turned to look, first, at me and Willie and, then, at his and Randall Wragge's horses. The animals were tied into Chips' stall, eating from their feed bags. Then he looked between us and the horses again, but with more *meaning*, and finished up with his head tilted to one side, eyes wide open in my direction.

Randall Wragge sighed. "Caleb, maybe the reason you get hungry so often is you ain't worked out what your mouth *does* yet. What stops you being polite and just asking the boy?"

Caleb Shivers stopped looking at me and turned to Randall Wragge. "I know what using my mouth and being polite gets me, Randall. How many times I need to say it? How can you get told?"

Randall Wragge sighed again and shook his head. From their manner, I guessed that this quarrelling was normal, rather than them getting ready to shoot each other. "Lucky Joe", he said, "a barn includes food, at least by my definition. So that agreement we made covers you fixing us a meal, don't it?"

That sparked something in me, but I held back my anger. "We ain't going to let a guest starve", I said, stony-voiced.

Randall Wragge sighed again. "I insulted Oklahoma before you came on out", he said to Caleb Shivers, as if that explained matters. "Don't be sore on that, Lucky Joe. What did this State ever do for you, anyhow? Seems like your soil ain't fit for a graveyard and most of what you earn, that fellow"—and he pointed at Fulton Gully—"ends up wearing".

"Or eating", Caleb Shivers said.

"*Okay*, Caleb", Randall Wragge said, spitting the words.

"We'll both go", I said and I gestured for Willie, who had been looking bemused this whole time, to follow me.

"Hurry back", Randall Wragge said.

"And just because I have to sleep like an animal, doesn't mean I want to eat like one", Caleb Shivers said.

As I shut the barn door, I could see that they'd already come together and started whispering out of Fulton Gully's earshot.

When we were out of the barn, Willie was jumping from foot to foot and desperate to talk, but I shushed him until we were a good distance down the driveway.

"Why'd that man say he was going to sleep here?", Willie said, when I let him speak.

"Just for one night", I said. "To help us. We owe Mr Gully a heap of money, Willie, and we don't have it. They'll help us get it."

"Sleep in a barn", Willie said, with scorn. And then he added, as if the fearful thought had just grabbed him, "Will they hurt Midnight Runner?"

"No", I said, and then I stopped him on the track by taking hold of his elbow. "Look, why are you even *here*? I told you to go to school".

"You told me Dad was at home", Willie said, and he wrenched his elbow away from me in anger. "But *Pete* said he saw him at Zalewski's place. He'll be sleeping there by now, Joe."

Well, I didn't like that news. I'd thought that Dad had gone into town with the butchered horse meat, and that it would take him a couple of days to spend the proceeds. But if he'd found a way to lose the meat, or lose the money, closer to home, then he'd be home by the evening, and I'd need to get rid of Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers much quicker than I'd planned. I didn't have the first idea how to do that.

"You know what else Pete saw, out at Zalewski's?", Willie said.

"What?", I said.

"A dog", Willie said, "Only, it was sat out on the porch, playing cards. And it was winning, Joe."

"Zalewski doesn't have a porch", I said, "People would fall off it".

The kitchen was empty when we got back to the house. The place seemed hollow; dust hung in the bright sunlight and nothing made a sound. Willie found some biscuits and gravy and got to heating them up.

While he was doing that, I went next door and opened Dad's chest. I knew there was a pistol in there. I didn't know if it would fire, since I'd never seen him use it, or clean it. But it was better than nothing and, unlike the shotgun, I could get it up to the barn without Randall Wragge and Caleb Shivers seeing. Sure enough, the pistol was there, underneath a lot of other junk, and I was just about to lay my hands on it, when I heard a rapping against the wall next to me, and I jumped back, startled.

A few seconds of silence, and the rapping started again—weaker this time, but still urgent-sounding. For a second I thought it was Dad, back already
