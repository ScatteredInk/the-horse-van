This book is not a work of fiction. Everything that you will read in these pages is based on archival research. The people, places and times have been switched around some, but they are real. I did not change much: a few names, the textures of the earth, the tint of the sky, the precise words chosen and the angle formed by the clock hands when those words were spoken. Details, only.

But, still, the historian has the power to go back and alter past events. That power comes not from lying, exactly, but from *finessing*. Fill in enough unknown details of the past, or smooth off enough of its rough edges, and a new interpretation of events starts to emerge: your's. This book would not exist if its protagonist had that same power. An animal unstartled, a different tone of voice, a look not returned, a barrel aimed a few degrees to the left â€” any of these could have led to a very different story, one not likely to have been recorded, or been so regretted.       

This book is not a work of fiction, then, but it is still based on a lie: that we can reach into the past, and change what we find there.
