This book is not a work of fiction. Everything that you will read in these pages is based on archival research. The people, places and times have been switched around some, but they are real. I did not change much: a few names, the textures of the earth, the tint of the sky, the precise words chosen and the precise moment those words were spoken. Details, only.

But, still, as a historian I have the power to go back and alter past events. That power comes not from lying, exactly, but from *finessing*. Fill in enough unknown details of the past, or smooth off enough rough edges, and a new interpretation of events starts to emerge: mine. 

This book would not exist if its protagonist had that same power. An animal unstartled, the same words uttered in another tone, a look not returned, the hands of the clock at different angle, a barrel aimed a few degrees to the left â€” any of these might have led to a very different story, one not likely to have been recorded, or been so regretted.      

This book is not a work of fiction, then, but it is still based on a lie: that we can reach into the past, and change what we find there.
